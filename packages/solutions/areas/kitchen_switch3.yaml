    trigger:
      # create triggerID's for each button for push/hold, and have corresponding actions in chooose-section
      # l= line,, so top line is l1 and bottom is l4
      # 'off_' means right button, while 'on_' means left button (as the K8 is inteded for 4 devices with one button for on/dimUp and one button for off/dimDown)
      # push is light push
      # hold is the brightnes_start - will be stopped by the stop_dimming trigger,, so keep the trigger-condition in each action (Thanks to John Inge for the logic)
      - id: stop_dimming    # trigger on all 8 buttons after a hold-action is ending. Johnn Inge instructs no action nessesary,, but this will break the loops in the hold-actions
