#   @description  :   Solution to make dumb appliances seem smart.  
#   @basic concept: 
#      Dumb heater is plugged into a ShellyS smartplug which 
#      Shelly integration provides data from to HA
#         sensors used:      
#            sensor.kitchen_heater_south_power
#            sensor.kitchen_heater_south_energy
#      (it also has a switch wihch one can trun off in case of
#      extreme powersaving-solutions - some time in the future)
