# Logitech Harmony Hub-integration
[Official HA-documentation](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/harmony/)


## How I use this integration:  
- Use IR-function on LHH from HA.  
  - Logitec Harmony Hub - integration, install, add IP of Harmony Hub
  - Teach Harmony Hub all functions you want to mimic
  -   NB; can add "non standard" devices and add/teach functions from remotes
- Prereqs:
  - Logitech Harmony Hub installed (it's a phyisical box)
  - Logitech Harmony App installed on your mobile phone,, and account created
  - Some IR-stuff that need HA controlling (within range of the Hub)

no config in this file,, just explenation on how to setup/reconfigure:


## Setup:
1. First setup Harmony Hub and connect with the Harmony App

2. Then add devices to harmony Hub,
   or teach Harmony Hub the codes/functions you want

3. Adding Harmony Hub integration in HA
   look for new config-file "/config/harmony_12427489.conf"
     in that file you will find the devices/commands you can use

4. Then add service-calls to activate the codes/functions you want

```ruby
action: call-service
service: remote.send_command
service_data:
  entity_id: remote.hubby
  command: PowerOn
  device: Vie Selected
```
