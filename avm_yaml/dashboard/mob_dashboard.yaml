# First step of building dashboard,, add views
# Could use include-command to include whole folder,,
# but I prefer to have manally control of which drafts to include in which dashboard,
# and especially the order of them.

  # first the "main view,, the mobile dashboard"
  - !include views/home_mob_view.yaml

  # first the "then some dashboards/views for specific areas "
