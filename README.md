## Home Assistant-config, and some self-hosted stuff


- This repo contains (part of) the working Home Assistant (HA) configuration for our home. It's clearly under development :)
- It also contains a wiki with setup of both HA and surrounding self-hosted services
- Below you find an overview of the the configuration, and in chapters links to config/devices currently being used, links to blog/video posts, and other HA enthusists that provided inspiration and configs to help build this config. 
<br />

### All of the code is free to use; I only ask that you 'Star' this repo.
