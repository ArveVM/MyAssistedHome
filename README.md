# Home Assistant config


- This repo contains (part of) the working Home Assistant configuration for our home. It's clearly under development :)
- Below you find an overview of the the configuration, and in chapters links to config/devices currently being used, links to blog/video posts, and other HA enthusists that provided inspiration and configs to help build this config.
