#   @integration  :   Home Assistant configuration
#   @description  :   Starting-poing of HA configuration
#   @basic concept: 
#      Using packages-functionality to structure configuration of EVERYTHING !
#      Learn more at https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/configuration/packages/#      
#
#      My main principle is to didvide Funtionality from Solution(s) 
#        - as my brain see the world of HA  :)
#
#        Functionality comes from Add-ons and Integrations
#          Add-ons and integrations are mostly configured in GUI
#          but if they need configuration (or additional sensors to add to 
#          existing functionality - that will be added in 1pc .yaml for each integration
#        Solutions are my onw abstract level to group functionality around
#          whatever I want to automate with HA
#
#      A descriptive readme-file is planned for my GitHub, but I got to start
#        somewhere, and this is the (fifth) start of my journey  :)
#
#   PS; lots of tribute to mrRR, Jeffrey Stone and Franck Nijhof for showing me 
#     good examples of config focused on either Functionality or Solutions, 
#     which I've arrogantly incorporated and called my own  :=)
