# First step of building dashboard,, add views
# Could use include-command to include whole folder,,
# but I prefer to have manally control of which drafts to include in which dashboard,
# and especially the order of them.

title: "Solutions Dashboard"
views:
  # first "the work in progress solutions"
  - !include views/solutions_draft_view.yaml

  # then "main view,, the finished solutions"
  - !include views/solutions_view.yaml
