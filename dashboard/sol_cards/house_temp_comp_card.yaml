# credits to Tommy Welle Jacobsson - HA-Norge-FacebookGroup for giving me the tip on this type config

# and the brilliant ThomasLoven for lovelace_gen
# use the following code to trigger card with whatever variables you would like (for me; for each area)
#      - !include
#        - ../../solutions/house_temp_comp_card.yaml
#        - entity: *temp1
#          area_temp_compare: sensor.house_average_temperature       #change to whatever you want to compare with
